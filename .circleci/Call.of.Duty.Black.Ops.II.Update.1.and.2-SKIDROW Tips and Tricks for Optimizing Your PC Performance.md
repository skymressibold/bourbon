# How to Use jBridge 16 to Run 32-bit VST Plugins in 64-bit Hosts
 
If you are a music producer or a hobbyist who likes to use VST plugins in your DAW, you might have encountered the problem of compatibility between 32-bit and 64-bit plugins and hosts. Some of your favorite plugins might be only available in 32-bit format, while your host might be running in 64-bit mode. Or vice versa.

One possible solution is to use jBridge 16, an application designed for bridging VST plugins in Windows (up to the 2.4 VST specification). jBridge 16 can make it possible to run 32-bit plugins in 64-bit hosts, or even bridging 32-bit plugins to 32-bit hosts, allowing you to overcome the memory limitations of a single 32-bit process[^1^] [^2^]. In this article, we will show you how to use jBridge 16 effectively and enjoy your plugins without any compatibility issues.
 
## What is jBridge 16?
 
jBridge 16 is an updated version of jBridge, an application that has been around since 2009 and has been used by thousands of music producers and hobbyists. jBridge 16 is compatible with Windows XP or above, and supports both VST2 and VST3 plugins. It works by creating a separate process for each bridged plugin, and communicating with the host using inter-process communication mechanisms[^1^] [^2^]. This way, it can avoid any conflicts or crashes that might occur when using different architectures or formats.
 
jBridge 16 has some features that make it stand out from other similar applications, such as:
 
- Integrated GUI mode: This feature allows you to integrate the plugin's GUI with your host's window, instead of having a separate window for each plugin. This can improve your workflow and save screen space[^1^] [^2^].
- Performance mode: This feature allows you to optimize the CPU usage and latency of each bridged plugin, by adjusting some parameters such as buffer size, priority, and audio thread affinity[^1^] [^2^].
- Custom plugin settings: This feature allows you to customize some settings for each bridged plugin, such as MIDI channels, audio inputs and outputs, automation behavior, and more[^1^] [^2^].
- Built-in support for some hosts: Some hosts, such as Cubase, FL Studio, Reaper, Bitwig and Renoise, have built-in support for jBridge 16. This means that you don't need to use the jBridger tool or any additional setup steps. The host will automatically detect and use jBridge 16 if needed[^1^] [^2^].

## How to Use jBridge 16?
 
To use jBridge 16, you need to purchase a licensed full version of the application for â¬14.99 from the official website[^2^]. You can also try the demo version first, which is fully functional except for saving and loading settings, and it will go silent after 20 minutes[^2^]. Once you have downloaded the application, you need to follow these steps:

1. Extract the zip file to a folder of your choice.
2. Run the jBridger tool (jBridger.exe) as administrator. This tool will scan your system for VST plugins and create bridged versions of them in a folder of your choice. You can also manually select which plugins you want to bridge or exclude[^1^] [^2^].
3. Configure your host to use the folder where the bridged plugins are located. For example, if you are using Cubase, go to Devices > Plug-in Information > VST Plug-ins Paths and add the folder where the bridged plugins are located. Then click Update Plug-in Information[^1^] [^3^].
4. Launch your host and load your project. You should be able to see and use your bridged plugins as normal. You can also access the jBridge settings for each plugin by clicking on the "

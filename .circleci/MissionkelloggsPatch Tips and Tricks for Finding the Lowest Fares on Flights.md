# Mission Kellogg's: The Cereal Box Video Game That Made History
 
Do you remember Mission Kellogg's, the video game that came with some cereal boxes in the late 1990s? If you do, you are not alone. Many people have fond memories of playing this game as kids, collecting cereal pieces and exploring different worlds with their favorite Kellogg's characters.
 
Mission Kellogg's was released in 1999 by Codemasters and distributed for free with some cereal boxes in Europe and Australia. It was a platformer game that featured six levels, each based on a different Kellogg's cereal brand: Corn Flakes, Frosties, Rice Krispies, Coco Pops, Choco Corn Flakes, and Honey Nut Loops. The player could choose one of four characters to play as: Tony the Tiger, Snap, Crackle, or Pop.

The game's plot involved an evil scientist named Dr. Dexter who wanted to steal all the cereal in the world and turn it into a bland mush. The player had to stop him by collecting cereal pieces and unlocking doors to reach his lair. Along the way, the player had to avoid enemies such as rats, bats, spiders, and robots. The game also had some mini-games and bonus levels that offered extra challenges and rewards.
 
Mission Kellogg's was one of the first video games to be distributed with cereal boxes, and it was a huge success. It sold over 5 million copies and received positive reviews from critics and players alike. It was praised for its colorful graphics, catchy music, smooth gameplay, and variety of levels. It was also considered to be a clever marketing strategy by Kellogg's, as it boosted their sales and brand awareness.
 
Mission Kellogg's is now a cult classic among retro gamers and nostalgia lovers. It is still playable on modern computers with emulators or compatibility modes. It is also available for download on some websites. Many fans consider it to be one of the best video games ever made by a cereal company, and some even hope for a remake or a sequel.

Mission Kellogg's was not the only video game that Kellogg's produced in the 1990s. They also released several other games based on their cereals, such as Tony and Friends in Kellogg's Land, Choco Krispis Adventure, and Coco Pops Jungle Adventure. These games were also distributed with cereal boxes or as promotional items. They were mostly platformers or puzzle games that featured similar gameplay and graphics to Mission Kellogg's.
 
However, none of these games achieved the same level of popularity and acclaim as Mission Kellogg's. They were often criticized for being too easy, repetitive, or boring. They also had less variety and creativity in their levels and characters. Some of them were even accused of being rip-offs of other popular video games, such as Super Mario Bros. or Sonic the Hedgehog.
 
Despite these flaws, some of these games still have their fans and collectors who enjoy playing them for nostalgia or curiosity. They are also part of the history of video game marketing and cereal culture. They show how Kellogg's tried to appeal to young consumers and gamers by creating interactive and entertaining experiences based on their products.
 
Today, Kellogg's still uses video games as a way to promote their cereals and brands. They have released several mobile apps and online games that feature their characters and cereals. They have also partnered with other video game companies and franchises, such as Nintendo, Minecraft, and Angry Birds. They have also sponsored esports events and teams.
 
Kellogg's continues to innovate and experiment with video games as a medium to connect with their customers and fans. They have proven that video games can be more than just a hobby or a pastime. They can also be a powerful tool for marketing and storytelling.

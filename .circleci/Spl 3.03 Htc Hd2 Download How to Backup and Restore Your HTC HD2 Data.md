# How to Download and Install SPL 3.03 on HTC HD2
 
If you have an HTC HD2 smartphone and want to install custom ROMs on it, you will need to flash a modified bootloader called SPL (Secondary Program Loader). SPL is responsible for running the operating system and setting what can be flashed on the phone. The stock SPL that comes with the HTC HD2 is CID locked, which means it only allows official ROMs released by HTC to be flashed on the phone. To bypass this restriction, you will need to install a custom SPL that is not CID locked, such as SPL 3.03.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install SPL 3.03 on your HTC HD2 using a Windows PC. Before you proceed, make sure you have backed up all your important data on your phone, as this process will erase everything on your device. Also, make sure your phone has at least 50% battery charge and that you have installed the latest HTC Sync software on your PC.
